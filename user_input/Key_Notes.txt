Here are the keynotes from the text:

**Network Topology**

1. Network topology refers to the arrangement of elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a communication network.
2. It can be used to define or describe various types of telecommunication networks.
3. Network topology is composed of physical and logical topologies.
4. Physical topology refers to the placement of network components, including the layout of cabling, node locations, and links between nodes and cabling.
5. Logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network.

**Categories of Network Topologies**

1. Physical topologies are determined by the capabilities of network access devices and media, level of control or fault tolerance desired, and cost associated with cabling or telecommunication circuits.
2. Logical topologies refer to the ways signals act on the network media or the way data passes through the network from one device to another.

**Types of Network Topologies**

1. Point-to-point topology
2. Bus topology
3. Star topology
4. Ring topology
5. Mesh topology
6. Tree topology
7. Hybrid topology
8. Daisy-chain topology

**Advantages and Disadvantages of Network Topologies**

1. Each topology has its own advantages and disadvantages.
2. Bustopologies are less expensive to implement, but can be a single point of failure and have limited bandwidth.
3. Startopologies are more reliable, but can be more expensive to implement.
4. Transmission media used to link devices include electrical cables, optical fiber, and radio waves.

**Network Speeds**

1. Network speeds range from 2 million to 10 billion bits per second for twisted pair cabling.
2. Optical fibers can transmit data at speeds of up to 1 trillion bits per second.

**Wired Technology Options**

1. Wired technology options are often more affordable than wireless alternatives, which command a higher price premium.
