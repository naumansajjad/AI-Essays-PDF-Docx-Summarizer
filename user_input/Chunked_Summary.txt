Network topology refers to the arrangement of elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a communication network, which can be used to define or describe various types of telecommunication networks. Network topology is the topological structure of a network and can be depicted physically or logically. It is an application of graph theory, where communicating devices are modeled as nodes and connections between devices are modeled as links or lines between nodes. Physical topology refers to the placement of network components, while logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network.

There are two basic categories of network topologies: physical topologies and logical topologies. Physical topologies refer to the transmission medium layout, including the layout of cabling, node locations, and links between nodes and cabling. Physical topology is determined by the capabilities of network access devices and media, level of control or fault tolerance desired, and cost associated with cabling or telecommunication circuits. Logical topologies, on the other hand, refer to the way signals act on the network media or the way data passes through the network from one device to another.

Network topologies can be categorized into various types, including ring, bus, mesh, and star topologies. For example, a local area network (LAN) can have a physical star topology with a central hub device connect to multiple nodes, while having a logical bus topology where data flows from one node to another. Similarly, a token ring network can have a logical ring topology but is physically wired as a star from a media access unit.

Transmission media used to link devices include electrical cables, optical fiber, and radio waves. Ethernet is a widely adopted family of transmission media used in LAN technology, which transmits data over both copper and fiber cables. Other transmission media include Power Line Communication, Coaxial Cable, and Fiber-Optic Cable.

The summary captures the essence of the context and main ideas, including the concept of network topology, physical and logical topologies, transmission media, and various types of network topologies. Here is a precise and accurate summary of the provided text:

Electromagnetic induction is used in twisted pair cabling, which comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP). Each form has several category ratings for use in various scenarios. Twisted pair cabling transmits data at speeds ranging from 2 million to 10 billion bits per second.

Optical fibers, which carry pulses of light that represent data, offer advantages such as low transmission loss and immunity from electrical interference. They can simultaneously transmit multiple wavelengths of light, enabling high data rates of up to trillions of bits per second. Optical fibers are used for long-distance transmission and are often used in undersea communications cables to connect continents.

Wired technology options are often more affordable than wireless alternatives, which command a price premium. However, business and employee needs may override cost considerations when deciding between wired and wireless technology. Wireless technologies include terrestrial microwave, satellite communication, and cellular and PCS systems, which use various radio communication technologies.

Free-space optical communication uses visible or invisible light for communication, while exotic technologies, such as IP over Avian Carriers and the Interplanetary Internet, have been experimented with.

Network nodes are the points of connection between transmission media and transmitters and receivers. A network node may be associated with a computer, but can also be a simple microcontroller or device. Network interfaces, such as network interface controllers (NICs), provide computers with the ability to access transmission media and process low-level network information.

The summary highlights the main ideas and context, covering the differences between wired and wireless technologies, the advantages and limitations of twisted pair cabling and optical fibers, and the various forms of network communication. Here is a summary of the text in a precise and accurate manner:

Network infrastructure components include repeaters, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and firewalls. Repeaters regenerate signals, but this can cause propagation delays and affect network performance. For this reason, many networks limit the number of repeaters used in a row. Bridges connect and filter traffic between network segments at the data link layer, breaking collision domains while maintaining broadcast domains. There are three types of bridges: local, remote, and wireless.

Switches forward and filter OSI layer 2 datagrams between ports based on destination MAC addresses. They can be thought of as multi-port bridges and typically have numerous ports, facilitating star topologies. Multi-layer switches can also route packets based on layer 3 addressing. Routers forward packets between networks by processing routing information and using routing tables.

Modems connect network nodes via wire or wireless connections and can be used for telephone lines or digital subscriber lines. Firewalls control network security and access rules, rejecting requests from unknown sources while allowing actions from recognized ones.

Network topologies include eight basic types: point-to-point, bus, star, ring, mesh, tree, hybrid, and daisy chain. Point-to-point topologies have dedicated links between two endpoints, while bus topologies have a single central cable connecting all nodes. Daisy chaining connects each computer in series, and ring topologies can be formed by connecting computers at each end of the chain.

The importance of each network component and topology is highlighted, including their roles in maintaining network performance, security, and connectivity. Here is a precise and accurate summary of the text:

Network topologies refer to the physical and logical arrangement of nodes and cables that connect them. There are several types of network topologies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

A bus topology is a linear network in which all nodes are connected to a single cable. Data travels along the bus and is received by all nodes simultaneously. This topology is less expensive to implement, but can be a single point of failure and has limited bandwidth.

A linear bus topology is similar, but with two endpoints, and requires a terminator device to prevent signal reflection. A distributed bus topology is similar, but with multiple branches and endpoints.

A star topology is a central hub connected to multiple nodes, with all traffic passing through the hub. This is the easiest topology to design and implement, but the hub can be a single point of failure and can create network bottlenecks.

An extended star topology adds repeaters to extend the transmission distance, while a distributed star topology connects multiple star networks in a linear fashion.

A ring topology is a closed loop in which data travels in one direction, with each node repeating the signal. This topology is good for high-speed networks, but can be affected by failures.

A mesh topology is a fully connected network, where each node connects to every other node. This provides great redundancy and fault tolerance, but is impractical for large networks due to the high number of connections required.

A partially connected mesh topology is a compromise, with some nodes connecting to one or more other nodes, but not every node connecting to every other node. This provides some redundancy and fault tolerance, but is less complex and expensive than a fully connected mesh.

Each network topology has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of topology depends on the specific needs and constraints of the network. Here is a summary of the text:

Hybrid networks combine two or more topologies, resulting in a unique network configuration. Examples of hybrid networks include star-ring networks, snowflake networks, and tree networks connected to other tree networks. These networks are distinct from standard topologies such as bus, star, ring, and mesh.

Centralization is a key concept in networking, and star networks can reduce the probability of network failure by connecting all nodes to a central node. However, the failure of the central node can cause the failure of all peripheral nodes. Tree networks, on the other hand, can be viewed as a collection of star networks arranged in a hierarchy, allowing for distributed functionality.

Decentralization is achieved through partially connected mesh networks, which provide redundant paths in case of link failures. Fully connected networks, also known as complete or full mesh topologies, have direct links between all pairs of nodes, providing high reliability but at a high cost.

Additionally, the text discusses daisy chain topology, which transmits messages from one node to the next, and hierarchical star networks, which are a combination of star and bus networks. The article also touches on the importance of network switches in managing network traffic and the potential for node failure in these topologies.

Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of various network topologies, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of centralization and decentralization, as well as the different types of hybrid networks.
